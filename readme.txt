5.Running ant task UpdatePluginVersion to update the Bundle Version of demo plugins:
  >ant UpdatePluginVersion
  With successful message, MANIFEST.MF in demo plugins should have been updated. 
  And new version control file will be generated under NewVersionControl folder, which should be checked into CVS for next day's build.
  
6.Running ant task UpdateFeatureVersion to update the Feature version:
  >ant UpdateFeatureVersion

Defined VersionUpdate task has 7 parameter need to be set value:
1.projectPath -- Absolute filepath of the plugin which need to be updated
2.suffix -- New BuildId (.vYYYYMMDD-MMSS)
3.cvsLogPath -- Absolute filename of generated cvs difference log file
4.logPath -- Absolute folder path where the new generated cvs version control file should be stored.
5.plugId -- Plugin Id whose version need to be updated
6.checkFlag -- This flag indicates if the plugin need to have version control. (value: Y/N)
7.cvsControlPath -- Absolute version control filename of the plugin.


Schema of version control file
------------------------------

There is two entry in the version control file:
<LastDate> 
Represents the suffix used in last build. If the codes hasn't changed, this part will keep same and MANIFEST will be updated with this value.
<DayInPast>
This param will be used in cvschanglog task, which represents how many days the bits havn't changed. 
If they were changed, this value will be reset to 1, or it will be repaced by <current value>+1.
Note: 
All the changes will be seen in the generated cvs control file locates in ${logPath}
